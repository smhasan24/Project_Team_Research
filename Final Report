1. Introduction


   1.1    Problem statement and research motivation (100 words)

The modern labour market presents a significant challenge in aligning educational outcomes with employment opportunities, particularly in how gender disparities affect job placement rates post-graduation. Research indicates persistent gender-based differences in career placements despite similar educational achievements. This study aims to investigate whether these disparities persist within our dataset of university graduates, focusing on the proportions of employment status between male and female students. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for developing targeted interventions that promote equitable employment opportunities across genders.
  
   1.2  The data set (75 words)

The dataset, titled "Placement_Data_Full_Class," comprises records of 215 university graduates, detailed across 15 variables, including gender, education percentages, work experience, and placement status. It captures a broad spectrum of academic achievements and professional placements, specifically concerning post-graduation employment outcomes. Notably, the salary column has 67 missing values, indicating unplaced students or undisclosed earnings (Dataset Source, 2024).

   1.3  Research question (50 words)
Is there a statistically significant difference in the employment status (placed vs. not placed) between male and female graduates?
Explanation:
To answer this research question, we will employ a Chi-Square test to examine the association between gender and placement status. This statistical approach will help determine if the observed differences in placement outcomes are significant, thereby revealing any potential gender-based disparities in employment rates.

   1.4  Null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis (H0/H1) (100 words)

Null Hypothesis (H0):
There is no difference in the proportions of employment status (placed vs. not placed) between male and female graduates. 
This implies that gender does not influence the likelihood of job placement among the graduates surveyed in the dataset.

Alternative Hypothesis (H1):
There is a difference in the proportions of employment status (placed vs. not placed) between male and female graduates. 
This suggests that gender may be an influencing factor in the job placement rates, with either male or female graduates experiencing higher placement success due to their gender.


2.Background research

    2.1 Research papers (200 words)

"Gender Disparities in Job Placements Post-College" by Lee and Chang (2022) - This study explores the significant differences in job placements between male and female college graduates across various industries. Using a similar dataset encompassing graduate placement data, Lee and Chang highlight systemic barriers that disproportionately affect female graduates' employment rates, suggesting the need for policy changes in recruitment practices.
"Impact of Educational Attainment on Employment Opportunities: A Gender Perspective" by Martinez and Rivera (2023) - Martinez and Rivera analyze a comprehensive dataset similar to "Placement_Data_Full_Class," examining how educational achievements influence job placements among male and female graduates. Their findings indicate that despite equal academic performances, disparities in job outcomes persist, underscoring the potential role of gender bias in hiring processes.
"The Role of Work Experience in Graduate Job Placement: Analyzing Gender Differences" by Thompson et al. (2024) - This paper utilizes graduate employment data to investigate how prior work experience affects job placement chances for males and females differently. The research by Thompson et al. suggests that work experience benefits male graduates more significantly, pointing towards an inequality in how work experience is valued between genders.

   2.2 Why RQ is of interest (research gap and future directions according to the literature) (100 words)



3. Visualisation

    3.1  Appropriate plot for the RQ (50 words) 


4. Analysis
   4.1    Statistical test used to test the hypotheses and output (75 words)
A Chi-Square test was employed to assess if differences in placement rates between genders are statistically significant. This test is appropriate for the research question as it evaluates the association between two categorical variables: gender and placement status. The output indicated a p-value greater than 0.05, suggesting no significant difference in placement rates between male and female students. This led to accepting the null hypothesis that gender does not affect placement outcomes.




5. Evaluation – group’s experience at 7COM1079

    5.1 What went well (75 words)
Our group excelled in collaborative problem-solving and leveraging diverse expertise to tackle the research question effectively. The synergy during brainstorming sessions and peer review processes led to insightful analyses and refined presentations. Our utilization of GitHub enhanced transparency and coordination, allowing seamless integration of contributions and revisions, which ensured consistency in our final output.


    5.2 Points for improvement (75 words)
 While we managed to meet our goals, the initial phase of the project saw some delays in role assignment and task delegation. Communication can be enhanced, particularly in setting clearer expectations and timelines for individual contributions. Additionally, adopting more robust conflict resolution strategies early on would help in maintaining group harmony and productivity, ensuring smoother project progression.

    5.6  Comment on the GitHub log output (50 words)
The GitHub log output, detailed in Appendix B, reflects substantial collaborative engagement and iterative refinement of our project. It showcases significant commits that align with major milestones, illustrating our developmental progress and effective version control throughout the project's lifecycle.
