# **Project: Team Research and Development Assignment**

## **Overview**
This repository contains the code and resources for the **Team Research and Development Assignment** as part of the coursework. The project analyses placement status among students based on gender using statistical methods. It aims to draw meaningful conclusions about potential disparities and provide actionable insights.

## **Features**
- Data preprocessing and cleaning scripts.
- Statistical analysis, including Chi-Square tests.
- Visualizations, such as bar charts and histograms.
- Comprehensive R scripts for data exploration and hypothesis testing.
- Git log tracking for project transparency.

## **Research Question**
**"Is there a difference in the proportions of placement status (placed vs. not placed) between male and female students?"**
